# Today

We are going to rip through building a rails engine.



# What the heck is a rails engine?

A rails engine is a miniature application that you can host within your rails app.

It's a mini rails app, inside your rails app.



# Why would I use one?

If you run a whole bunch of rails sites, you quickly realize you're reinventing the wheel, writing the same screens over and over.

If you want to write that code just once, and reuse it anywhere, rails engines are the best way to do that.



# The rails engine go-to guide

A well written official guide is available.

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html

You can totally follow this and build a blog inside a rails engine and learn all the best practices.

But, I'm going to totally ignore this and today we will build our own thing.




# Let's go already

So I want to build something non-trivial, that shows off the power of rails engines, in like 10 or 15 minutes.

We are going to build a 1-page rails engine that can be used to validate all the records of any rails app.

We're gonna build:

- A rails engine
- A controller with just one action
- Some custom stylesheets
- A rails ActiveRecord concern
- Maybe just a bit more



# Effective Website

So this is my rails starter website. I use this as a starting point whenever I build a new app.

* Show effective website *



# Create a new rails engine

> rails plugin new validator --mountable

* Add validator/ directory to VSCode *


Let's check out the structure.

It looks pretty close to a rails app.


# Gemspec

So without going into it too much, a rails engine is a gem.

As with any gem, the .gemspec file describes the package, its dependencies, and all the meta info.

Before we can even use it, we have to remove these TODO and FIXME commands from the


# Bundle it

In Gemfile:

gem 'validator', path: '~/Sites/validator'

> bundle install

That's all we gotta do to add the engine to our rails app.



# Hello Engine

So, everything we code here is going to be contained inside the rails engine.

Let's create a controller:

app/controllers/validator/validations_controller.rb

module Validator
  class ValidationsController < ApplicationController
    protect_from_forgery with: :exception

    layout 'application'

    def index
    end

  end
end


And a route in config/routes.rb:

Validator::Engine.routes.draw do
  scope module: 'validator' do
    match '/validations', to: 'validations#index', via: :get
  end
end


And create a view:

Create validator/validations/index.html.erb:

<h1>Hello Engine</h1>

<div id="validations">
  <p>This view is being served from the validator engine</p>
</div>

And one gotcha, we need to give this engine a name, so rails knows whats up with it:

lib/validator/engine.rb:

engine_name 'validator'


# Mount the engine in our rails app

config/routes.rb:

mount Validator::Engine => '/', :as => 'validator'

You could also mount it to another directory

This will show up in rake routes now


Add it to our navbar:

app/views/layouts/_navbar.html.haml:

= nav_link_to 'Validator Index', validator.validations_path


# Let's see it in action

> bundle exec rails server

visit

http://localhost:3000/validations

Sure enough, we have a working page here.


# Let's add a quick stylesheet

So the page looks ugly, and we're not really going to improve on that.

But we can add a stylesheet for a designer to come save us.

Let's create app/assets/stylesheets/validator.css

#validations { background: lightgray; }

And add it to our app stylesheet

@import 'validator';


# Let's add a module variable

Okay, this page looks pretty ugly.

Really, I just want to be able to use bootstrap, or tailwind, or whatever I have.

I need a way for the parent app to tell my engine view which html classes to use.

Let's create a module/engine top level variable to do that.

In validator.rb:

mattr_accessor :html_classes

def self.setup
  yield self
end

Make a default config file:

config/validator.rb

Validator.setup do |config|
  config.html_classes = ''
end

So my pattern is to put the default file in this here config/ directory.

And then a rails generator to install that into the parent app's config/initializers/ directory

lib/generators/validator/install_generator.rb

module Validator
  module Generators
    class InstallGenerator < Rails::Generators::Base
      include Rails::Generators::Migration

      desc 'Creates a Validator initializer in your application.'

      source_root File.expand_path(__FILE__)

      def copy_initializer
        template ('../' * 4) + 'config/validator.rb', 'config/initializers/validator.rb'
      end

    end
  end
end

> rails generate validator:install

Generates the initializer file which gets run whenever our app starts.

Let's check it out, and add some default classes.

In config/initializers/validator.rb

config.html_classes = 'card card-body'

> bundle exec rails server

And back in our rails engine, let's reference this module variable:

index.html.erb

<h1>Hello Engine</h1>

<div id="validations" class="<%= Validator.html_classes %>">
  <p>This view is being served from the validator engine</p>
</div>

So now our parent app can tell our engine to render the div with its own classes


# Okay now let's build something that does stuff

Okay, cool, so now we're going to create an ActiveRecord concern
That we can add to any model, just to keep track of it


app/models/concerns/acts_as_validation_source.rb

module ActsAsValidationSource
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  mattr_accessor :descendants

  module ActiveRecord
    def acts_as_validation_source(*options)
      include ::ActsAsValidationSource

      (ActsAsValidationSource.descendants ||= []) << self
    end
  end

  def is_valid?
    valid?
  end

end


And we need to register this concern with ActiveRecord

engine.rb

# Include acts_as_addressable concern and allow any ActiveRecord object to call it
initializer 'validator.active_record' do |app|
  ActiveSupport.on_load :active_record do
    ActiveRecord::Base.extend(ActsAsValidationSource::ActiveRecord)
  end
end

  -# Make sure all the classes are loaded (development mode fix)
  - Rails.application.eager_load!

  - ActsAsValidationSource.descendants.each do |klass|
    %h2= klass.name.pluralize

    %table.table
      %thead
        %tr
          %th Name
          %th is_valid?
          %th

      %tbody
        - klass.all.find_each do |resource|
          %tr
            %td= resource.to_s
            %td= resource.is_valid?
            %td= resource.errors.full_messages
