  # config.role_descriptions
  # ========================
  # This setting configures the text that is displayed by form helpers (see README.md)
  #
  # Use this Hash syntax if you want different labels depending on the resource being editted
  #

  # config.assignable_roles
  # Which roles can be assigned by whom
  # =======================
  # When current_user is passed into a form helper function (see README.md)

  # Use this Hash syntax if you want different permissions depending on the resource being editted
  #

  #     :superadmin => [:superadmin, :admin, :member],  # Superadmins may assign Users any role

  # }

  # config.disabled_roles
  # Which roles should be displayed as disabled
  # =========================
  # Sometimes you don't want a role to be assignable (see README.md)
  # So that you can overload it yourself and assingn the role programatically
  #
  # Use this Hash syntax if you want different permissions depending on the resource being editted
  #
  # config.disabled_roles = {
  #   'User' => [:member]               # When editing a User object, will be unable to assign the member role
  #   'Page' => [:superadmin, :admin]   # When editing a Page object, will be unable to assign superadmin, admin role
  # }
  #
  # Or just keep it simple, and use this Array syntax of permissions for every resource
  #
  # config.disabled_roles = [:member]
  #
  # or
  #
  # config.disabled_roles = {
  #   'User' => [:member]
  # }


  # config.authorization_method_for_summary_table
  # This has absolutely no affect on the any logic involving roles
  # It's purely for the effective_roles_summary_table() helper method
  #
  # It should match the authorization check used by your application
  #
  # Use CanCan: can?(action, resource)
  config.authorization_method = Proc.new { |controller, action, resource| authorize!(action, resource) }

  # Layout Settings
  # Configure the Layout per controller, or all at once
  config.layout = 'admin'
