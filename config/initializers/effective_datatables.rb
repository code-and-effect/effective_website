  # Authorization Method
  #
  # This method is called by all controller actions with the appropriate action and resource
  # If the method returns false, an Effective::AccessDenied Error will be raised (see README.md for complete info)
  #
  # Use via Proc (and with CanCan):
  # config.authorization_method = Proc.new { |controller, action, resource| authorize!(action, resource) }
  #
  # Use via custom method:
  # config.authorization_method = :my_authorization_method
  #
  # And then in your application_controller.rb:
  #
  # def my_authorization_method(action, resource)
  #   current_user.is?(:admin)
  # end
  #
  # Or disable the check completely:
  # config.authorization_method = false

  config.authorization_method = Proc.new { |controller, action, resource| authorize!(action, resource) }

  # Date & DateTime Format
  # By default, format Date and DateTime values with the following
  config.date_format = '%Y-%m-%d'
  config.datetime_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'

  # Boolean format
  # If :yes_no, display as yes_no instead of true/false
  config.boolean_format = :yes_no

  # Format integer columns with the following proc or function
  config.integer_format = :number_with_delimiter

  # Default number of entries shown per page
  # Valid options are: 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 1000, :all
  config.default_entries = 25

  # When using the actions_column DSL method, apply the following behavior
  # Valid values for each action are:
  # true (always include a link to this action)
  # false (never include a link to this action)
  # :authorize (include link only if authorized to show/edit/destroy the resource class)
  # :authorize_each (include link only if authorized to show/edit/destroy the resource)
  # Proc.new { |resource| can?(:edit, resource.parent) }
  #
  # When :authorize, a single check will be made via the above config.authorization_method
  # to see if the current_user has permission to :show/:edit/:destroy the collection class, i.e. Post
  # EffectiveDatatables.authorized? (:show || :edit || :destroy), Post
  # This is a faster permission check, because it only checks the class once
  #
  # If you want to authorize each individual resource, use :authorize_each
  # EffectiveDatatables.authorized? (:show || :edit || :destroy), Post.find(1)
  #
  # You can override these defaults on a per-table basis
  # by calling `actions_column(show: false, edit: true, destroy: :authorize)`
  config.actions_column = {
    show: :authorize,
    edit: :authorize,
    destroy: :authorize,
    unarchive: :authorize
  }

  # Which packages to load when using the charts DSL
  config.google_chart_packages = ['corechart', 'gauge', 'geochart']
